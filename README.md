# Reduct-Compiler

In this project, we will build a compiler for a language called Reduct. There will be three phases.

# Phase 1

In phase 1, We should build the grammer of Reduct language using its document. 
Lexical Analyzer and Parser are located in the lexical and syntax analysis directory and grammer.g4

# Phase 2

In phase 2, We should build a semantic analyzer for our compiler.
Semantic analysis is done in the semantic analysis directory. files are ExpressionTypeChecker.java, NameAnalyzer.java, TypeAnalyzer.java.

# Phase 3

In the final phase, code generation will be handled using Jasmin assembler.
